# Visma.NET Payroll's assignment repo.

In this repo you will find technical assignments used for recriutment purposes.

Default access in this Github org is none, thus you need to be given access to a repo directly or a team to view anything.

There are two roles/teams. 
## Assignment creators
> The individuals responsible for maintaining the assignment templates, keeping them up to date and relevant
## Assignment reviewers
> Individuals who use the assignments during recriutment.


## Steps to use template for a new candidate assignment
1. Clone the correct assignment template into a new repo named payroll-tech-assignment-[name of candidate]
> The easiest way is to select from the repository template menu in GitHub's "Create new repository"-workflow
1. Give candidate access to this repo specifically as a outside collaborator
> As the default access is *none*, the repo will only be visible for the creator and direct assignees.
1. Let candidate push to repo and deliver his/her assignment.
