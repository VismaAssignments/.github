# Visma.NET Payroll's assignment repo.

In this Github org you will find technical assignments used for recriutment purposes.

Default access in this Github org is *none*, so you need to be given access to a repo directly or a team to view anything.

There are two roles/teams. 
## Assignment creators
> The individuals responsible for maintaining the assignment templates, keeping them up to date and relevant
## Assignment reviewers
> Individuals who use the assignments during recriutment.


## Steps to use template for a new candidate assignment
1. Clone the correct assignment template into a new repo named payroll-tech-assignment-[name of candidate]
> The easiest way is to select from the repository template menu in GitHub's "Create new repository"-workflow
1. Give candidate access to this repo specifically as a outside collaborator
> As the default access is *none*, the repo will only be visible for the creator and direct assignees.
1. Let candidate push to repo and deliver his/her assignment.

## Creating a new template
1. Create a new repository with the following naming scheme: [template/team name]-recruitment-techtest-template
1. Mark it as a template repository in the repository settings menu
1. Give assignment reviewers team READ access
1. Give assignment creators team WRITE access
